>   "Bring me pictures of Spider Man!" - J. Jonah Jameson


Demand drives design, and there is no demand without show of value. It's not enough to prove value, you must get interest. To pitch pro, you have to pitch a lot, and if you are not pitching, you are showing that you are producing good output. 

Clear tasks set clear work. Pitch a clear, specific brief. This is useful when you are showing your work later. Determine needs at the beginning. It will be a useful guide later, and make your work more valuable and focused. 

The topic of showing your work could fill books, but you either have pictures of Spider Man or not.
Translation: Show your work
