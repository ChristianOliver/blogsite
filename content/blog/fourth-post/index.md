### Flavor
Style is almost like flavor. Thinking in adjectives helps. Creamy, edgy, sharp, soft, salty, or caramel. Can you imagine representing neapolitan through style on a website landing page? Would it be swirly? Rounded? Think in elements of design and illustration, and adjectives such as friendly, open, trendy,or confident. Style works. Make it work.
### Corporate Style
Search for style guide. From Apple to Zapier, there is an offical style guide for every company and most any kind of design. They are best practices for company design. Illustration, photography, language, colors, user interfaces, design elements...and the list goes on. Looking at style guides and learning the processes behind designing for these companies is a bigger education than most books on design.

### Personal Style
Personal style takes a while. Keep on creating. Style comes more naturally as long as you keep creating. It's like parkour. You can't have a parkour style if you don't parkour. Keep practicing and trying new things.

### Personal Work Style
It's where industry meets personal. A venn diagram where the two intersect. This might be a good time to look for inspiration and guidance from people in the same industry. They've faced similar problems and were able to bring themselves to the market.
