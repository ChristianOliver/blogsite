### Ask the right questions now
This post is about bigger projects in design. The most imporant tool in design is the question. The second is the calendar, and the third is the list. They will save you and a client time, effort, and money. 

### I've got a little list
The bigger the project, the more important it is to have hard requirements. It can save you from endlessly chasing irrelevant options and features that could be changed literally five minutes later. (This is as true in design as it is in software.)

Here's a sample outline for a design brief:


#### 1. Project Overview

-Objectives and intended project outcomes

-Project and client background

-Deliverables and deadline

-Budget

#### 2. Business background

-Brand description and style

-Competitors and partnerships

-Trends and target audience
### Solutions not options
People want options. Give options, but focus on solutions. If the options are not what's wanted, find out specifically why. Every project has a "why" and a "for". The bigger the project, the more options are asked for. 

### Carousel of options
However, not all options are created equal. Quantity of options doesn't mean quality of options. If an extra option doesn't solve what the others don't, the quality of options has not increased. When you provide lots of options (not necessarily a bad thing), get good feedback.

### Feedback
The best way to take feedback is to listen carefully, show value, present with clarity, and take responsibility. Sometimes the wrong option can help understand the right solution. Why? Because what's wrong often evaluates what's right. The more feedback you get, the more you know the "do"s and "don't"s. The more you know these things, the more you can pitch solutions with confidence.
